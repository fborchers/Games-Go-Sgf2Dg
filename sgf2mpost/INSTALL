Sgf2mpost is a tool for producing encapsulated postscript files
from Smart Go Format files. The program creates a text file
which can be run through metapost to produce the postscript
file. Most diagrams found in any typical Go book can be
produced by this method.

Sgf2mpost is a part of the Sgf2Dg distribution. See
the Sgf2Dg manual for details.

You may need to edit Makefile, making MPOST the path to metapost.

To create sgf2mpost, just run 'make sgf2mpost'.

sgf2mpost -h reports the following help string:

-i <input file>
-o <output file>
-s <start move>       first NUMBERED move number or board location
-e <end move>         last move number or board location displayed
